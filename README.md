Server side scipts for Digital Paintball 2


quick explanations on those scripts:

- DP2-Discord-Connector: chat between DP2 server and Discord server
- bot: adds 10 bots / player 
- hostage: A game mode I am working on. One player is chosen as hostage. Red team has to free him, Blue tries to stop that. Needs specifically designed map
